Feature: User configuration
  In order to have ability to change configuration on user level
  As admin
  I need to be able to make such changes

  Scenario: Add comments to user entity
    Given I login as administrator
    And I go to System/User Management/Users
    And I click Configuration on admin in grid "Grid"
    And I click "Display settings"
    And I uncheck "look_and_feel[oro_ui___navbar_position][use_parent_scope_value]"
    And I select "Left" from "Position"
    When I press "Save settings"
    Then I should see 1 "div.main-menu-sided" elements

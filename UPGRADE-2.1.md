- Deprecated services and classes:
    - `oro_search.search.engine.storer`
    - `Oro\Bundle\SearchBundle\Engine\Orm\DbalStorer`
- `entityManager` instead of `em` should be used in `BaseDriver` children
- `OrmIndexer` should be decoupled from `DbalStorer` dependency
 
##SecurityBundle
- Service overriding in compiler pass was replaced by service decoration for next services:
    - `sensio_framework_extra.converter.doctrine.orm`
    - `security.acl.dbal.provider`
    - `security.acl.cache.doctrine`

##LayoutBundle
